# Preprocessing the context after retrieval

1. Story :
    - After retrieval of the documents from the (vector) database, we'll apply preprocessing on that before feeding to the LLM.
    - First cyclomatic complexity analysis will be done. This will tell us most probable hotspots for the error & bugs.
    - Then in above hotspots, we'll delve deeper using Abstract Sytax tree(AST) and will feed the analysis of corresponding hotspots to the LLM.
